# Dance_Forms_Detection
Dance Form Detection is a process of classification of dance type. when any human, who does not have much knowledge regarding the forms of dance views, any dance image, it is difficult to tell which type of dance form he/she is performing in that particular image. Hence to solve this problem I have come across a solution which detects the dance form.
I classify 8 dance forms of Indian Classical Dances.
1. MOHINIYATAM
2. ODISSI
3. KATHAKALI
4. BHARATANATYAM
5. KUCHIPUDI
6. SATTRIYA
7. KATHAK
8. MANIPURI
